# SlideySlides

`SlideySlides` is  librry and presentation tool for telling stories one screen at a time.

It's especially optimized for adding a visual "track" to longform audio storyeliing of the kind done by [Reveal](https://www.revealnews.org/) and [APM Reports](https://www.apmreports.org/). 

It's based heavily on a storyboard metaphor and inspred heavily by the [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/). It also draws on the reveal codebase, albeit for a very different purpose.
